# The Labs

The purpose of this is for you to *learn*, not *get done*. The suggestions for the labs are to help guide you.

You almost *never* get to write code "free-style" -feel free to let your freak flag fly and vary from the "requirements".

**ASK QUESTIONS IF YOU GET STUCK**

I Will show you how to get started and how to send me a pull request.

Good luck and Godspeed.
